%Considerazioni:
%	i requirements sono stati scritti con questa idea:
%	una compagnia può “proporre” una internship a uno studente 	(manca uno scenario per questo, potrebbe essere aggiunto a quello della notifica). Si veda il requirement “R10602”
%	non ho modellizzato il concetto di “richiesta di candidatura” (ma uno si candida e basta). Se non sei d’accordo lo metto.
% mettere nelle definizioni la differenza tra internship e internship advice
