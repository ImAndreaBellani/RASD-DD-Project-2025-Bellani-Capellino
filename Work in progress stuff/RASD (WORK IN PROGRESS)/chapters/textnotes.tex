\chapter{Specific requirements}
	\section{External Interface Requirements}
		\subsection{User Interfaces}
		\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
			There are no specific hardware interfaces required, except for the devices used to access the platform. Both students and companies need a hardware device (such as a computer) with a network card to connect to S\&C.
		\subsection{Software Interfaces}
				To manage the sending of all notifications (recommendation notifications, notifications for selection results, etc.) between two or more users, the \textit{mail service} must be used. In fact, both students and companies are required to provide their email address (university/company email) during registration. Every time the system sends a notification to a user, they will receive an email informing them of the received notification. To view the content of the notification in more detail, the user must log into the system and go to the appropriate section of the platform.
				
				To do this, the system will send a request to the mail service, which will then forward the desired email to the specific user.
		\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
			Both students and companies use the Internet to access the platform; in particular, companies require an Internet connection for all the functionalities they can perform through the platform (posting internship advice, configuring the selection process, etc.). Similarly, students also need an Internet connection for their functionalities (searching for internships, applying, etc.).
			
			Due to the confidentiality of exchanged data, a secure communication mean is required, such as HTTPS or VPN.
	\section{Functional Requirements (and goals mapping)}
		Here are described all the functional requirements of the S\&C platform.
		
		\subsection{General requirements}
		
		[R00000] when a notification of a user is generated, the user receives it on its mailbox (in a more concise version) and can consult it on its notification section
		
		\subsection{Requirements related to goal G1}
		
		[R10101] the system allows students to sign up to the platform with their institutional mails

		[R10403] the system allows students to filter the results they searched (e.g. ”only paid internships”, ”only companies located in Lombardy”)
		
		[R10404] the system allows students to consult the list of all published internship advice, listed from the most recent to the last
		
		[R10501] when the system recognizes that a new internship advice that might interest a student (that allowed the recommendation option) published, it notifies that student
		
		[R10601] when the system recognizes that a student has a profile that would fit an internship advice, the company that published the advice is notified (for students and companies that both take part into the recommendation analysis)
		
		[R10701] the system allows students to apply for any internship advice which deadline has not expired
		
		[R10702] when a student applies for an internship, the related company is notified by the system
		
		[R10801] the system allows companies to approve, discard or ignore each application they may receive for one of their published advice

		[R11102] when a company ends a selection process, the system provides to it a non-compulsory questionnaire regarding its experience (in the context of that selection process) 
		
		[R11201] when a student concludes an internship, the system provides to him/her a non-compulsory questionnaire regarding him/her experience (in the context of that internship) and in the meantime it provides to the internship company an analogue questionnaire also non-compulsory 
		
		\subsection{Requirements related to goal G2}
		
		[R20101] when the deadline for an internship advice is expired, the system allows the company to set up the selection process by specifying for each step, the relative questionnaire (with metrics for each question) and the date in which provide it to a student (dates may differ between different students)
		
		[R20102] the system includes into a selection process only student that had an accepted application for the relative internship advice
		
		[R20201] the system notifies students for any interview date that interest them
		
		[R20202] the system allows companies insert students answers into the system
		
		[R20203] the system automatically calculates the scores of questionnaire closed answers
		
		[R20204] the system allows companies to manually insert scores for questionnaire open answers
		
		[R20205] the system allows companies to visualize and compare selections scores
		
		[R20206] in any selection phase, the system allows companies to discard a student currently involved in the selection process (discarded students are removed by the selection process)
		
		[R20207] in any selection phase, the system allows companies to accept a student currently involved in the selection process (accepted students are removed by the selection process)
		
		[R20208] the system allows companies to write a personalized message to communicate the result of a selection
		
		[R20209] when a selection result is prepared for a student (with the relative message), it is notified to the student
		
		[R20210] when a selected process related to an internship advice has ended, the system deletes the advice
		
		\subsection{Requirements related to goal G3}
		
		[R30101] the system allows students and companies to consult the internships (ongoing or finished)
		
		[R30102] the system allows students and companies to report complaints (at most 50 words)on the internships they are involved in
		
		[R30103] the system does not allow users different from their creator to consult complains
		
		[R30104] when an ongoing internship finishes (ending date is reached), involved users are notified and the system still permits users to see it but marks it as "closed"
		
		[R30105] the system allows companies to manually close their ongoing internships (each one) before the closing deadline

			in the figure it is represented the activity diagram associated do the selection process running UC; in this case we prefer use an activity diagram to represent also the interaction, during the selection interview, between the 2 actors without explicitly using the system; in fact, the filling of the questionnaire and the oral answers are all done without the use of the system; then, to collect the answers, the company use the system and the student receive a notification with the outcome of the interview for this step (Accepted, Rejected, Suspended)
		
	\section{Performance Requirements}
		For the system functions related to user navigation, we require a response time up to 5 seconds.
		
		The mail notification system should send any notification at most 1 minute after the moment in which the notification was generated.
		
		The recommendation system should produce its results with at most 1 week of distance from the last time it produced them.
	\section{Design Constraints}
		\subsection{Standards compliance}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Since S\&C uses personal data of users, it is necessary that the platform is in compliance with the General Data 		 Protection 	Regulation (GDPR), a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA).
				
				\item The CVs uploaded by students on the platform must necessarily be in the EUROPASS format in order to be processed by the system.
			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Hardware limitations}
		
			To make the best use of the platform, it is necessary that the devices used to access it meet (at least) the following requirements:
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item\textbf{Internet Connection}: a stable connection of 5 Mbps is required for a smooth experience. This would support navigation on the platform and viewing content. Slower connections may lead to long loading times on pages with a lot of data (note that we don't expect that the application provides large multimedia resources, such as high-quality images or videos);
				\item \textbf{Screen Resolution}: users should have devices with screens of at least 1280x720 px to ensure a good visual experience.
			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Other constraints}
			The platform is designed to allow companies to advertise their internships and for students to find internships relevant to their studies. Therefore, S\&C average users may not have a strong knowledge of UI graphic conventions (e.g. conventional icons), this implies that UI has to be designed in order to meet these usability standards.
	\section{Software System Attributes}
		\subsection{Reliability}
			Considering the criticality of the information managed by the application (e.g. interview dates, CV, e-mail addresses) we require an high level of reliability in each sub-part of the system.
			
			For the recommendation system reliability we ask for a... .
		\subsection{Availability}
			Since the application does not have real-time interactions or much critical functions to ensure, if the system went down for few hours it would not be an huge concern for most users. However, there some functions that require an higher level of availability than the others:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item notification system: it should be available for at least one hour in a day, in order to guarantee that notifications are not sent to users with a delay higher than one day (since notifications are also sent by email, we can rely on the availability of users mail servers, as stated in the assumption section);
				\item selection process system: it is highly recommended that the selections calendars and the relative questionnaires are available at least in work hours. As we stated in the assumption section, we always take for grant the fact that companies (and students) have a copy of calendars (and also of the questionnaires) for the companies;
				\item ongoing internship monitoring: at least in work hours, the monitoring system should be available. Little down-times are still tolerated but it is highly recommended that for the majority of the time is possible to monitor the ongoing internship status.
			\end{itemize}
			As general rule, maintenance should always occur off the work hours of the majority of the companies registered.
		\subsection{Security}
			In this section we define the main kinds of security concern that the system should address:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item e-mails sent from the system always have to be sent from a certified mail address. Moreover, e-mails sent from the system must be encrypted and must not contain any password;
				\item attacks related to system availability (e.g. DOS), to data confidentiality, integrity and users authenticity must be taken into consideration, also considering the public nature of the application;
				\item uploaded CV should be scanned to ensure that they don't contain viruses.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Maintainability}
			For S\&C, which manages multiple users (students and companies) and handles a large amount of sensitive data, maintainability is a crucial aspect:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the code has to be well documented and tested; in particular, a testing routine has to be provided to check if the system still work or not.
				\item The system structure should provide the ability to deploy updates in the back-end without the users noticing it
				\item to facilitate maintainability, system components should be created to be as modular as possible
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Portability}
			We highlight the fact that the application targets are students and companies that may use operative systems of any kind, therefore portability should be increased, in order to spread the audience. On the other hand, non-desktop devices (such as mobile devices, smartwatches ecc.) are not an huge concern of this kind of application, so we don't put much effort on emphasizing the portability also in this direction. At the end, we encourage portability but we ask for it at least for general purposes desktop operative systems.
